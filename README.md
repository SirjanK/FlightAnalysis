# Flight Delay Analysis
We play around with some flight delay data to analyze how it varies based on origin, destination, airline, and time of day.

## Analysis Notebook
See `FlightDelayAnalysis.ipynb` for some example analysis.

## Web App
Run using `python3 app/run.py`. 

It allows optional user input for fields and computes the delays for `>= 30mins`, `>= 2hrs` and plots `P(delay > T) vs T`.
The user can select which configurations for conditioning they want to see in the plot.
